# Twitch Bot

This is my Twitch integration and chat bot, primarily made for [Rawreltv](https://www.twitch.tv/rawreltv).

Currently it is only able to manage user access tokens, connect to Twitch chat, request capabilities, and authenticate as the bot user. I am slowly working on implementing each part of the underlying protocol before working on any major features.
