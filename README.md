# Twitch Bot

This is my Twitch integration and chat bot, primarily made for [Rawreltv](https://www.twitch.tv/rawreltv).

## Running

The recommended way to run this bot is by using the [Docker image](https://github.com/users/viral32111/packages/container/package/twitchbot). This image is automatically updated every time a commit is pushed.

For example, this command will run the bot in a Docker container using a custom configuration file in the current directory:

```
docker run \
	--name twitch-bot \
	--mount type=volume,source=twitch-bot,target=/var/lib/twitch-bot \
	--mount type=bind,source=$PWD/config.json,target=/etc/twitch-bot.json \
	ghcr.io/viral32111/twitchbot:latest
```

### Configuration

The configuration file is where you should specify Twitch application credentials, channel names, etc.

The default configuration file will be created at the default path, or at the path given as the first command-line argument to the program.

The default path for the configuration file for each operating system is:
 * Windows: `%CD%/twitch-bot.json`
 * Linux: `$PWD/twitch-bot.json`

### Persistent Data

The bot will create data over time that must be retained across reboots.

The location of this directory can be changed in the configuration file. The default for each operating system is:
 * Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/TwitchBot`
 * Linux: `/var/lib/twitch-bot`
 
### Cached Data

The bot will create temporary data over time that is reused across reboots, but can safely be destroyed when closed.

The location of this directory can be changed in the configuration file. The default for each operating system is:
 * Windows: `%TEMP%/TwitchBot`
 * Linux: `/var/cache/twitch-bot`

### Development

When running during development, it is preferred to keep secrets in the [.NET user secrets store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets).

These secrets can be set using the `dotnet user-secrets set` command. The following secrets are required:
 * `AppClientSecret` should be your Twitch application's client secret.
